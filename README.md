**PROMPT**: “Where there any parts of my previous prompt that were not useful to you?”
Honestly this was a game changer and helped me get rid of chaff in my prompts. More often than not it will tell you specifically what was ignored and why but you might need to pry a bit more with something like:
“Explain why that/those part(s) of the prompt were ignored.”
If you are feeling particularly lazy you can even just write:
“Suggest a rewrite of my previous prompt and exclude any parameters, details, or text that was not interpreted by you and was not useful to the results.”

**PROMPT**: If you are posting something to the OpenAI API and you are getting nonsense/dumb responses on the JSON, try adding this before the desired request:

It may look dumb, at the beginning I thought the API was nerfed, but I realize that I was just making request without giving GPT a "purpose", by using this I'm getting more consistent answers from the API.
